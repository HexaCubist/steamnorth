		<h1>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</h1>
		<p>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</p>
		<p>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</p>

		<h2>Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</h2>
		<p>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. We're also Santa Claus! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</p>
		<p>That's not soon enough! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Pansy.</p>
		<h3>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.</h3>
		<p>Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Why yes! Thanks for noticing. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
		<p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! I'll get my kit! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! No! Don't jump!</p>
		<p>As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
		<p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</p>
