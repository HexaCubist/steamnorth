		<h1>Welcome to Steam North Whangarei</h1>
		<p>The Whangarei Steam &amp; Model Railway Club was founded in 1978 by the first president Vic Seymour. Since then, the Johnny, Price, Seymour, Union Foundry and more have joined our family of locomotives.</p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>We've built a timeline of the history of Steam North, and you can view it on the About Us page.</p>

		<p>That's not soon enough! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Pansy.</p>
		<h3>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.</h3>
		<p>Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Why yes! Thanks for noticing. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
		<p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! I'll get my kit! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! No! Don't jump!</p>
		<p>As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
		<p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't veryâ€¦ Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</p>
