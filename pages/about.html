		<h2>Who we are</h2>
		<p>The Whangarei Steam &amp; Model Railway Club was incoporated in 1978, and operates several small railway lines within the heritage park. We have regular open days on every third Sunday of the month, and have a number of projects within the club working on locomotives and model railways.</p>
		<h2>Our History</h2>

		<p>The Whangarei Steam &amp; Model Railway Club would not be possible without the support and grants from organisations such as ASB Trust, Lotteries Commission and Pub Charities.</p>
		<h2>A Brief History of Heritage Park Railway</h2>
		<p>The railway is operated by The Whangarei Steam &amp; Model Railway Club Inc. The club became an incorporated society in about 1978 thanks to the guiding hand of its first president Vic Seymour after whom our Peckett steam locomotive is named.</p>
		<p>The first track was laid at the museum in about 1977. It was on the site of what is now the loco shed and about a metre higher than the present track in there. At first a couple of jiggers were used for rides. These are still operational at the club.</p>
		<p>In 1978 the 0-4-2 Peckett steam locomotive was donated to the club by Wilson’s Portland Cement Works, south of Whangarei. The Peckett was the last new steam locomotive to be imported into New Zealand. Two A cars were acquired from NZR and at first the little loco dragged one of them up and down a short piece of track on a severe gradient. This sort of operation would not be allowed today!! Soon a couple of redundant H class cattle wagons were procured and converted for passenger use. These proved to be perfect for the job and the A cars became redundant.</p>
		<p>The first station was where the white picket fence and wall are situated. The station building was the Kauri building which is now our museum. The Peckett was housed in a small tin shed approximately where our pedestrian crossing is now situated. Eventually, in about 1983 a small engine shed was built to house the loco. This was subsequently extended to its present size. By this time, the severe gradient had been bulldozed to a more acceptable one on its present alignment past the engine shed. </p>
		<p>The wooden A cars deteriorated badly and were scrapped. The frame of one of them was removed to the Bay of Islands Vintage railway and now houses Hundertwasser’s boat the La Giudecca. The other frame was cut up. Part of it was used to make the turntable and 30 years later the rest was used to make our blue bogie carriage.</p>
		<p>In 1982 the Hikurangi station arrived. The Kauri station was then converted into a small museum and the track extended about 40m into the new station.</p>
		<p>By this time the track had been extended through Millington Bush and ended in the middle of a paddock. This area is now the site of our large, red storage shed.</p>
		<p>In 1989 the railway rescued a second Peckett from a plinth on Tarewa Park. The ravages of 20 years on the park had taken its toll. At first there were thoughts of restoring it to working order but it has been in store, mainly out of sight, on our tracks since that date. </p>
		<p>About the same time the Union Foundry rail tractor was purchased from Northland Fertiliser of Whangarei. This little loco is very useful for work trains but little else as its braking capacity is somewhat limited. We wonder how it used to move and stop loaded fertiliser wagons.</p>
		<p>In 1991 we acquired the Drewry from Kamo scrap metals, initially on loan but eventually purchased. This little 0-6-0 diesel loco greatly simplified operations because it now became possible to run trains mid week with limited staff who could not operate the steam loco but could easily be taught to operate a diesel loco. </p>
		<p>Around 2000 the lower section was re routed through Millington Bush to a new station called Millington Bush. The opportunity was also taken to put in a lower and upper loop by making use of the existing lower main line and an upper siding. A new station was also created on the upper loop called Milnes. </p>
		<p>In the later 2000’s a now derelict H wagon frame was rebuilt to take passengers. This meant that we now had two passenger carrying H wagons, one blue and one brown.</p>
		<p>In 2005 a Price 0-4-0 shunter works #200 was donated from Ballance Fertilisers of Whangarei. This has been a very valuable second string loco.</p>
		<p>Around 2007 a Bagnall 0-6-0 diesel locomotive ex Portland was purchased from Avon Industries of Kamo minus motor. A smaller replacement motor was purchased but this has never been installed and it is stored at our lower storage shed. </p>
		<p>In 2007 the Peckett was reboilered and extensively overhauled, including new side tanks and new cab. It was also repainted from blue to green which was thought to be its original colour when it arrived from the UK in 1956.</p>
		<p>About 2011 a large storage shed with three tracks was completed on a paddock at the lower end of the line. This meant that all our rolling stock could now be kept under cover in a secure, dry environment. Two further tracks were added in 2015 and a covered lean to added in 2016 so that all five tracks are now covered. .</p>
		<p>A new track extension was built to the front of the museum using the outside siding at Hikurangi as a starting point. A new platform was also built at Hikurangi to service this line. A new station has also been built at the top terminus near to the museum complex. This new piece of track runs parallel with state highway 14 for about 150m.</p>
		<p>In 2012 a new bogie passenger carriage was completed by our members. It utilised part of the frame of our old A carriage on two roller bearing fitted bogies purchased from the railways. It is fitted with an emergency braking system.</p>
		<p>The club acquired two trams from Henderson in late 2014. One has been regauged and re wheeled and its renovation is almost complete. It will be operated using a 600 volt diesel generator to provide the electricity. The trams were originally from Lisbon, in Portugal and spent a number of years in Aspen, Colorado, USA. Henderson started to refurbish them but then stopped so we took them over. It is intended to run them on the Milne’s extension but they will be capable of running anywhere on our system.</p>
		<p>In 2012 a track was bulldozed from the Millington station area down to Barge Park. Rails were purchased from Glenbrook Vintage Railway and the track as at late 2014 is being laid on the formation. This has now been extended into the museum’s lower paddock.</p>
		<p>The railway has been operated throughout its existence by volunteers. At present (2014) we have an excellent bunch of volunteers who are ensuring the safe operation of the railway and also the extension to Barge Park.</p>
		<p>The railway pays its way by charging for rides. Most of the capital works which have been undertaken have only been possible because of grants from organisations such as ASB Trust, Lotteries Commission and Pub Charities.</p>
