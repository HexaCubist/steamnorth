<p>You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! We're also Santa Claus! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Kids have names?</p>
<p>Who are those horrible orange men? Also Zoidberg. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? <strong> A sexy mistake.</strong> <em> I don't want to be rescued.</em> Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</p>
<h2>I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.</h2>
<p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Bender?! You stole the atom. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Shut up and get to the point!</p>
<ol>
<li>How much did you make me?</li><li>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</li><li>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!</h3>
<p>Soon enough. I never loved you. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I never loved you.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</li><li>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!</li><li>And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</li>
</ul>
