<h1>And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</h1>
<p>You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! We're also Santa Claus! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Kids have names?</p>
<p>Who are those horrible orange men? Also Zoidberg. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? <strong> A sexy mistake.</strong> <em> I don't want to be rescued.</em> Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</p>
<h2>I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.</h2>
<p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Bender?! You stole the atom. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Shut up and get to the point!</p>
<ol>
<li>How much did you make me?</li><li>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</li><li>You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!</h3>
<p>Soon enough. I never loved you. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I never loved you.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</li><li>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!</li><li>And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</li>
</ul>

<p>No argument here. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.</p>
<p>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
<p>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Meh. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?</p>
<p>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. When will that be? Shut up and take my money!</p>
<p>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. No! The cat shelter's on to me. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?</p>
<p>Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Is that a cooking show?</p>
<p>Kids have names? Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Daylight and everything.</p>
<p>It's toe-tappingly tragic! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</p>
<p>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Noooooo! I don't want to be rescued. I just told you! You've killed me!</p>
<p>Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</p>
<p>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</p>
